            <h6 class ='text-style '>Parking:</h6>
            <p id='wrightsvilleParking' class='center-align'> When parking at Wrightsville Beach, keep in mind that there is no free parking on the island and the metered spots are limited (especially during the summer). We recommend showing up early to guaruntee your crew a convenient spot near the break you are hoping to surf at. This paid parking costs $5/hr or $25/day and is in effect from March 1st through October 31st between the hours of 9am and 7pm everyday, so dawn patrol sessions are free if you time them correctly! The easiest parking is in front of Johnny Mercer's pier or over by the Oceanic Restaurant, depending on what part of the island you are hoping to surf. </p>
            <p id='carolinaParking' class='center-align hide'>When parking at Carolina Beach, make sure you pay attention to the parking signs in the immediate area. Metered parking is much more limited, so this beach friendlier for the afternoon session surfer (as long as the beach isn't too crowded). We recommend parking a street or two off of the beach in the residential areas and walking a bit. Residents tend to be friendly towards beachgoers as long as you respect the parking immediately infront of their houses. When in doubt, just ask!</p>
            <p id='surfcityParking' class='center-align hide'> When parking at Surf City, it is extra important to pay attention to the signage of the area in which you park. Surf City has a variety of parking options that vary in cost, and the city even offers a parking pass for the April 1st - October 31st paid parking window. If you plan on making this your home break, we recommend spending the $250 on the parking pass. It is definitely a steep price to pay to be able to surf, however your options here are limited and the pass pays for itself if you spend more than 10 days at the beach. It is ver IMPORTANT to get to the beach early during the busy summer months if you dont want to have to walk quite a distance with all of your beach gear. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class = 'surfModal'>1-2ft: Beginner waves! This size is perfect if you are still learning the basics and want a calm environment to practice your paddling and popups. Make sure the board you grab is nice and long and has a good amount of volume because waves of this size won't have very much power behind them. We recommend beginners use at least an 8ft board to ensure there is enough stability and float to give you the best chance to succeed!</li>
                        
                        <li class = 'surfModal'>3-5ft: Intermediate waves! This size is great for surfers who have (mostly) figured out their paddling and their popups and are ready to start riding the waves. These waves tend to have a bit more power behind them, allowing surfers to choose from a wider variety of boards to ride. If you are still unsure of what board works best for you, we recommend a fun board or mid-length to still provide plenty of float while allowing you to start to work on nice smooth turns on the open face of the wave.</li>
                        
                        <li class = 'surfModal'>6ft+: Advanced waves! There's a saying in surfing that goes, "when in doubt, don't go out!" Safety is very important and the ocean should always be respected. If you truly feel comfortable consistently surfing 3-5ft waves, definitely give these waves a try! However, it is important that you surf with a buddy (at least the first few times), and you understand teh conditions specific to the surf break you paddle out at. At this point you should know which boards you like to ride in what conditions and you are ready to get shacked! Enjoy the surf, waves of this size don't come very often!</li>
