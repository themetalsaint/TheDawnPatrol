# The Dawn Patrol


## Description:
We have developed an application showing the current weather and surf forecast for key NC surf locations. The goal was to create an applicaiton that is user friendly and compatiable with a mobile phone to check the weather information.



```
User Story:

THEN I should see a current weather and surf forecast
The Surfer displays the heght of the tides and reflects the time of day
WHEN I click on MORE INFO button
THEN a modal shows wave explainations based on skill
