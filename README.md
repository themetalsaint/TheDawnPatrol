# The Dawn Patrol


## Description:
We have developed an application showing the current weather and surf forecast for key NC surf locations. The goal was to create an application that is user friendly and compatable with a mobile phone to check the surf information.



```
User Story:
As a person interested in surfing
WHEN I select a beach from the drop down
THEN I should see a current weather and surf forecast
The Surfer displays the height of the waves (relative to a 6ft person) and reflects the time of day
WHEN I click on MORE INFO button
THEN a modal shows wave explanations based on skill
WHEN I refresh the page
the site stays on the selected beach.
```
